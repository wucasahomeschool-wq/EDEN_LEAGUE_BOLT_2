// Derives a behind-the-scenes personality description for a user-controlled
// manager based on their actual on-record activity. User managers cannot type
// a personality (their field always reads "USER CONTROLLED"), so AI features
// that need one — negotiation, messaging, other managers reacting — call this
// helper instead of reading the raw `personality` field.
//
// Weighting rationale: press conferences are PUBLIC and the most reliable
// signal (heavy weight); direct messages are private but still on-record
// (medium weight); firing/hiring actions are loud one-off signals (light
// tie-break). Everything falls back to "balanced professional" if the manager
// has no history yet.
