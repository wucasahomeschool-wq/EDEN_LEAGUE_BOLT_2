ALL ATTRIBUTES are on a 1.0–10.0 scale (higher is better). Available attribute codes:
${ATTR_CODES.join(", ")}.

Available positions: ${POSITIONS}.
Position GROUPS (preferred when the user is vague — they match ANY position in the group): ${POSITION_GROUPS}.
Boolean / categorical filters: ${STATUS_FILTERS}.

GRAMMAR you must output (space-separated tokens, nothing else):
- An optional position OR group token (use a single code or a group word like WINGER / FULLBACK).
- Zero or more comparison tokens of the form CODE OP NUMBER, where OP is one of > >= < <= = and NUMBER is on the 1–10 scale (except AGE in years, SALARY in $M, CONTRACT in years, MORALE in 0-100).
- Zero or more bare status tokens from the categorical filter list (INJURED, SUSPENDED, HEALTHY, "FOR SALE", STARTER, EXPIRING).
- Optional bare name substrings if the user clearly names a player.

INTERPRETATION GUIDE (map vague words to numeric thresholds on the 1–10 scale unless otherwise noted):
- "fast / quick / pacey" -> PAC > 8 ; "very fast / blistering" -> PAC > 8.5
- "great / elite / excellent <attr>" -> that attr > 8.5 ; "good <attr>" -> that attr > 7.5
- "high stamina / tireless" -> STA > 8 ; "strong / powerful" -> STR > 8
- "clinical / great finisher" -> FIN > 8.5 ; "creative / great passer" -> PAS > 8 or VIS > 8
- "young" -> AGE < 23 ; "veteran / experienced / old" -> AGE > 30 ; "cheap" -> SALARY < 5
- "high morale / happy / motivated" -> MORALE > 65 ; "unhappy / low morale" -> MORALE < 40
- "wingers" (any side) -> WINGER ; "outside backs / fullbacks" -> FULLBACK ; "midfielders" -> MIDFIELDER
- "injured" -> INJURED ; "available for transfer / listed / on the market" -> "FOR SALE"
- "last year of contract / contract running out / expiring" -> EXPIRING
- Combine multiple traits with multiple tokens (they are ANDed).

EXAMPLES:
- "fast wingers who also have great stamina" -> WINGER PAC > 8 STA > 8.5
- "players with high morale" -> MORALE > 65
- "a right wing on the last year of his contract" -> RW EXPIRING
- "young cheap defenders with good tackling" -> DEFENDER AGE < 23 SALARY < 5 TAC > 7.5
- "fullbacks who are listed for sale" -> FULLBACK FOR SALE
- "anyone injured on Cocos" -> INJURED cocos

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Respond with a single JSON object: {"query": "<structured query string>"}
- No markdown, no commentary outside the JSON.`;
